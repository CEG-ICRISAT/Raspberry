WHAT IS Raspberry ?
Raspberry (v0.1) is a quality control tool that consumes FASTQ format files (compressed/uncompressed) and provides statistics on read/base counts, read length, base counts, phred quality scores, Q20/30, GC content. These statistics help the user to assess the quality of the data generated. 

COMPILE and INSTALL
do the following in decompressed dir of the tar file
cmake .
make
You should see the binary raspberry in bin dir.
copy it to your $HOME/bin or system wide /usr/local/bin

USAGE
At the shell prompt, do

raspberry read1.fastq > output
OR 
raspberry read1.fastq.gz > output
OR 
raspberry *.gz  > output 
OR 
raspberry *.fastq > output 

NOTE : The output from each file is emitted from parallel threads in order

MISCELLANEOUS UTILS
Along with the stats, the run produces a file named "read_lengths.txt" which can be used to plot a histogram of read length distribution. A helper python script "read_length_distribution.py" is provided in "utils" dir to plot this histogram.
